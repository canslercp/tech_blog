# Tech Blog
   
  ## Description
  A CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and view other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site was built completely from scratch and deployed using Heroku. The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
